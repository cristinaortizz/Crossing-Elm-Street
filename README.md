Game: Crossing Elm Street Dining Hall 

Collaborators: Cristina Ortiz, Sophie Zhu, Ishaan Singh 

Instructions: Use the arrow keys to move around and avoid colliding into students as they stroll across the busy Elm Street Dining Hall. Be on the lookout for spills across the floor as well; each collision with a student or spill will result in the loss of a live, and the player's location will be reset to the start point. Speed and quickness will be tested; you must complete each level within the time limit. Food is available as a boost throughout each level for an extra player live.
